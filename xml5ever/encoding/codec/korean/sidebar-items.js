Unlike KS X 1001 (and EUC-KR) which only contains a set of 2,350 common Hangul syllables, it assigns remaining 8,822 Hangul syllables to the two-byte sequence which second byte have its MSB unset (i.e. `[81-C6] [41-5A 61-7A 81-FE]`). Its design strongly resembles that of Shift_JIS but less prone to errors since the set of MSB-unset second bytes is much limited compared to Shift_JIS."]]});
