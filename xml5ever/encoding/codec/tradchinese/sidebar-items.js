initSidebarItems({"struct":[["BigFive2003Encoder","An encoder for Big5-2003."],["BigFive2003Encoding","Big5-2003 with common extensions. (XXX with asymmetric HKSCS-2008 support)This is a traditional Chinese encoding spanning the region `[81-FE] [40-7E A1-FE]`. Originally a proprietary encoding by the consortium of five companies (hence the name), the Republic of China government standardized Big5-2003 in an appendix of CNS 11643 so that CNS 11643 plane 1 and plane 2 have an almost identical set of characters as Big5 (but with a different mapping). The Hong Kong government has an official extension to Big5 named Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS).This particular implementation of Big5 includes the widespread ETEN and HKSCS extensions, but excludes less common extensions such as Big5+, Big-5E and Unicode-at-on."]]});
